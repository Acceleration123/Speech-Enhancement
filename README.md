# Speech-Enhancement
Practice on speech enhancement exploiting deep learning method. The neural network we choose is TF-GridNet, an excellent architecture in the field of speech separation, more details can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03952.

However, in this repository, we also combine progressive learning strategy with original TF-GridNet to achieve better enhancement performance. Pre-trained models under two different strategies are available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krMSO78aNgLXAPRHsqjZVi07k4AkLoj_/view?usp=sharing & https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NbIED2f79Uw9P5H5zRWcSanl4mWuQJiJ/view?usp=sharing
